        07","picture":"https://jackfperryjr.github.io/moogleapi-images/logos/ff07.jpg","platform":"Sony
        Playstation","releaseDate":"January 31, 1997","description":"The seventh main
        installment in the Final Fantasy series. Published in Japan by Square, it
        was released in other regions by Sony Computer Entertainment, and became the
        first in the main series to see a PAL release. The game''s story follows Cloud
        Strife, a mercenary who joins an eco-terrorist organization to stop a world-controlling
        mega-corporation from using the planet''s life essence as an energy source.
        Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of Sephiroth, a superhuman intent
        on destroying their planet. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships
        with his party members, including Aerith Gainsborough, who holds the secret
        to saving their world.\r\n\r\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the
        Super NES. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several
        platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the
        advantages of the CD-ROM format. Veteran Final Fantasy staff returned, including
        series creator and producer Hironobu Sakaguchi, director Yoshinori Kitase,
        and composer Nobuo Uematsu. The title became the first in the series to use
        full motion video and 3D computer graphics, which featured 3D character models
        superimposed over 2D pre-rendered backgrounds. Although the gameplay systems
        remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, Final Fantasy VII introduced
        more widespread science fiction elements and a more realistic presentation.
        The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing
        budget of around US$80 million.\r\n\r\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign,
        Final Fantasy VII received widespread commercial and critical success, and
        remains widely regarded as a landmark title and one of the greatest games
        of all time. The title won numerous Game of the Year awards, and was acknowledged
        for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and popularizing Japanese role-playing
        games worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story,
        although some criticism was directed towards its English localization. Its
        success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia sub-series
        called the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, and an upcoming high-definition
        remake for the PlayStation 4."}]'
