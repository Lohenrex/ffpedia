        green mage born in a certain country which sought to produce mages for the
        sole purpose of aiding others in battle. Cerius was an orphan trained exclusively
        in magic by the state, which led her to grow a bit indifferent towards people.
        However, she was always keenly aware of her surroundings and thus managed
        to retain her empathy, unlike her desensitized fellow green mages. She later
        fled the country, but no records of her reasons behind this act remain.","pictures":[{"id":"cf66b57c-a3c1-4149-8b83-08d850052b8b","url":"https://mooglestorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/cf66b57c-a3c1-4149-8b83-08d850052b8b.jpg","primary":1,"collectionId":"8fdd0a98-5533-4550-fa67-08d850052414"}],"stats":[]}'
